# Auto11
## What is this?
Auto11 is a tool designed to make doing an in-place upgrade on windows easy once again.

It allows you to enable flight signing with a proper GUI, then easily mount and dismount a Windows Installer iso.
Once the iso is mounted, a button is used to execute the installer with the right command line arguments to bypass system requirements.

## Usage
- You may need to install the .NET 8.0 Runtime for desktop, if so download the installer [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.3-windows-x64-installer) and follow instructions for installation.

- Enable flight signing mode and reboot
  ![Enable Flight Signing](https://github.com/mastercodeon314/Auto11/assets/78676320/ba964fda-8148-4250-9a4f-eec3db539621)
  
- Once flight signing is enabled, simply select your iso for the windows installer and mount the iso.
  ![Mount Iso](https://github.com/mastercodeon314/Auto11/assets/78676320/081a4a14-b877-481c-bed7-8d5386ff19a8)

- Now that your iso is mounted, just click the Start Upgrade button then the installer will be launched, as well as all requirements being bypassed!

## Notes
- Usage depends on what build of windows you are upgrading from.
- This is because flight signing mode must be turned on when upgrading to a windows insider build.
- If you are already on an insider build, you will skip the Enabling flight signing mode step. 
- Enabling flight signing mode will require a reboot, and the program will not allow you to continue. 
- Also note that currently, there is no detection of the version of windows you are upgrading to from this app. 
  That means that for now, there is no support for upgrading from an older release build (flight signing will be off in this case), to a newer release build.

## Roadmap
- Creation of a tab that can patch a windows installer iso for TPM requirements.
- Support for non Insider releases of Windows, not requiring Flight Signing enablement.
- Optimization of app startup
